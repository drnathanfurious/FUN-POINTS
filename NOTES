- Changed Makefile to make it prettier
- Use compiler flags to specify 8 bytes for every real.  Removed duplicate
	specifications in main.f90
- Included nlopt and a dummy optimization routine.

The permutation problem is troubling for me, because given N points we have
to try and search N! possible permutations of the adjancency matrix.

Shiny ascii from ess.  I look at his code and realize that he is a LVL 12
Wizard, while I am only a LVL 2 Druid.

Just so I don't forget, here's how to set up and clone a github repository.  

1.  Make sure your SSH keys are added under
https://github.com/account/ssh

2.  Add a remote upstream
git remote add upstream git@github.com:drnathanfurious/FUN-POINTS.git

3.  Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:drnathanfurious/FUN-POINTS.git

4.  Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

I don't think it's necessary to use the 'real*8' syntax if the compiler
flags specify real as 8 bytes anyway.  But I'll leave that for now.

Added the usual files, plus a BONUS.  The file "oder" shows an error I saw
while watching another version of this program try and converge.
